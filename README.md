JavaScript MapReduce Example

In Functional Programming, functions may be assigned to variables, and functions 
may be passed as arguments to other functions.

Functional Programming languages usually implement the <em>MapReduce</em> paradigm, 
including the Map, Filter, and Reduce functions.

While it is possible to write imperative <em>MapReduce</em> code, functional methods 
are easier to read and reason about, and are usually optimized for execution speed.

A few simple examples of <em>MapReduce</em> are given in the JavaScript files.
+ imperative.js shows imperative implementations of map, filter, and reduce functions.  It works, but isn't elegant.
+ functional.js shows functional programming using map, filter, and reduce functions.  It has immutable data arrays,
 fewer variable declarations, and is easier to read and reason about.
