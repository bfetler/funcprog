### Functional Programming

In [_Functional Programming_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), functions may be assigned to variables, and functions 
(anonymous or not) may be passed as arguments to other functions.

Functional Programming languages usually implement the [_MapReduce_](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/01/from-mapreduce-to-javascript-functional-programming/) paradigm, 
including the Map, Filter, and Reduce functions. While it is possible to write such data transforms using imperative code, functional methods may be easier to read and reason 
about, and usually use immutable arrays and are optimized for execution speed.

A few simple examples of Functional Programming are given in the directories.

ruby/
+ imperative.rb shows imperative programming examples of map, filter, and reduce methods.
+ functional.rb show functional programming examples of map, filter, and reduce methods.

javascript/
+ imperative.js shows imperative programming examples of map, filter, and reduce functions.
+ functional.js shows functional programming using map, filter, and reduce functions.  It has
 fewer variable declarations, and is easier to read and understand.
